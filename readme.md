<h2 name='overview'>Overview</h2>
 
<h3>Introduction</h3>
 
Forada Limited wanted a personalised website that they could update. Peregrine Communications designed the site and asked me to build it. They wanted no ability to scroll down, except for disclaimer pages.
 
<h3>Deployment</h3>
 
The site can be viewed currently on Peregrines test server: http://peregrine.design/forada <br>

<h2 name='brief'>Brief</h2>
 
- **Build the site to look like the deisgn giver**
- **No scroll** except when viewed on a phone and disclaimer pages
- **Allow no devs to update content**
 
<h2 name='tech'>Technologies used and why?</h2>
 
<strong>PHP</strong> wordpress uses PHP<br>
<strong>Wordpress</strong> because non-developers can update content.<br>
<strong>Advanced Custom Fields</strong> allows non-devs to update content on a personal theme.<br>
<strong>Underscores starter theme</strong> to allow me to create my own wordpress theme using Sass.<br>
<strong>JavaScript</strong> to build animations.<br>

<h2 name='app'>Site</h2>

The site has a nice design with no ability to scroll apart from view disclaimers or on a phone. It is fully responsive and contains interactive maps.<br> <br> <br>

<h2 name='approach'>Approach</h2>
My approach was to keep it simple. Use Sass with multiple files to make it easy for other devs to come in and work on it. Luckily Underscores has a really easy to understand layout.

<h3>PHP</h3>
This was my first time using PHP, I found it fairly easy. 
<br>
<br>
<h2 name='blockers'>Blockers</h2>
<h3>Advanced Custom Fields</h3>
This tricky to grasp at first, as the design of this plugin was poor.
<br>
<br>
<h2 name='bugs'>Bugs</h2>
<h3>No bugs for a client</h3>
It is unacceptable to have bugs in a finished piece for a client.<br>
